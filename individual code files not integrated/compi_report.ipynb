A consistent increase in net profit generally attracts investors, leading to higher share prices and increased investor interest.

This is a significant decrease.\\n\\n**Impact on Investors:**\\n\\nA decrease in COGS, holding other factors constant, is generally positive for investors. It suggests that the company is becoming more efficient in its production process, leading to higher profit margins.  This could translate to higher earnings per share (EPS) and potentially a higher share price.  However, investors should investigate the reasons behind this decrease.  Was it due to lower input costs, increased efficiency, or a change in product mix?  Understanding the underlying causes is crucial for a complete assessment.

Higher revenue suggests the company is growing and potentially more profitable.  However, investors should also consider other factors like profit margins, expenses, and overall profitability to make a complete assessment of the company's financial health and investment potential.  A consistent increase in revenue, coupled with healthy profit margins, would be a very strong positive signal.

The company's exposure stems from long-term financing, short-term borrowings, bank balances, term deposit receipts, loans to employees, and advances to subsidiary companies. Variable-rate instruments expose the company to cash flow interest rate risk, while fixed-rate instruments expose it to fair value interest rate risk.  A 1% fluctuation in interest rates at year-end could impact profit before taxation by 337.083 million Rupees (2024) or 101.288 million Rupees (2023).  The Group's figures are similar but higher (413.772 million Rupees in 2024 and 245.465 million Rupees in 2023).\\n\\n* **Currency risk:** Changes in foreign exchange rates impact the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.

Lower profitability translates to lower earnings per share (EPS), potentially leading to a decrease in the company's stock price and reduced returns for investors.  Investors will want to understand the reasons behind this COGS increase (e.g., rising raw material costs, increased labor costs, higher energy prices).  If the increase is unsustainable or indicates poor management, it could lead to a loss of investor confidence.
